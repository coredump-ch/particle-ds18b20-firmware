# Water Temperature Sensors

This project aims at building a network of internet-connected water temperature
sensors around the ZÃ¼richsee using the Particle Electron.

The prototype is a regular indoor temperature sensor using the Particle Photon.


## Photon Setup

Install the Particle CLI: https://docs.particle.io/core/cli/

Log in to your Particle account:

    $ particle login

Set up your device:

    $ particle setup wifi


## Flashing

To flash the firmware to a Particle Photon, first list the available Photons:

    $ particle list

Then flash the current directory:

    $ particle flash <0123456789ABCDEFGHI> .

(Replace the device id with the id found in the first command output.)


## Wiring

To wire a DS18B20 sensor to the Photon:

- VCC (usually red) -> 3.3V
- GND (usually black or blue) -> GND
- Data (usually yellow or white) -> D0
- 4.7k resistor from Data to VCC
